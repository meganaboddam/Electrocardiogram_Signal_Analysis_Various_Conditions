The purpose of this lab is to understand electrical biological signals, acquire the signal, and analyze the signal in digital form. An electrical biological signal is produced from the electrical discharge of various cells in the body. Studying the electrical biological signals produced by the body is crucial to understanding its physiology. During this lab, an electrocardiogram signal (EKG) is used- this signal is produced by a cascade of electrical signals that begin in the sinoatrial node (SA), located in the upper right atrium. The continuous signal produced by the heart must be converted into a form that a computer can analyze. To do this, the signal must pass through an analog to digital (A/D) converter, that transforms the analog signal to a discrete, binary signal. The binary signal is imputed into a computer software that provides a visual representation of the EKG signal. The EKG signal contains two major sections, depolarization and repolarization. The region of the EKG signal that represents when the signal from the SA reaches the right and left ventricles is referred to as the QRS complex.
#### Condition One/Two 
In order to determine the most advantageous electrode location, the team attached electrodes to various locations on Kimâ€™s body.
#### Condition Three 
Once the lead configurations were determined, the participant was asked to do aerobic exercises for 60 seconds. Immediately following the exercises, the wires were connected to the chosen electrodes and 60 seconds of EKG signals were recorded.
#### Condition Four 
We then asked the participant to perform the Valsalva maneuver. The participant was allowed a two minute break before performing this next step. The Valsalva maneuver is performed by forcing exhalation with closed airways- normally carried out by closing the mouth, pinching the nose, and attempting exhalation. The Valsalva Maneuver causes characteristic changes in systemic blood pressure, which should in turn change the frequency of the heart beat.
#### Condition Five 
Lastly, the sampling frequency on Loggerpro was decreased to 5 hz. This test was performed with the consistency from the first runs, with the participant sitting, maintaining a cool composure. By decreasing the sampling frequency to less than twice the heart beat frequency, the QRS complex was lost in the graph.
